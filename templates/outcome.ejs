        The course on global/world literature and social change has been a transformative experience, allowing me to
        explore the intricate relationship between storytelling and societal changes. Beginning with a basic
        understanding of these concepts, I delved deeper to uncover their interplay and discover how literature and film
        can shape our perspectives and drive social change. By immersing myself in diverse literary forms, such as
        novels, graphic novels, short stories, and poems, and engaging with cinematic films, I have gained a profound
        understanding of the transformative power of storytelling and its role in shaping perspectives, challenging
        societal norms, and igniting movements for change.

    <p>
        This exploration allowed me to unravel the layers of meaning embedded within the narratives, and understand the
        profound impact that literature and film can have on society. Applying close reading techniques, I dissected
        selected examples, revealing hidden messages, alternative perspectives, and the nuanced nuances of symbols and
        themes.

        In conclusion, this course has been a transformative experience, allowing me to appreciate the intricate
        relationship between global/world literature and social change. The practical application of close reading
        extended beyond classroom discussions. As I move forward armed with the tools and insights gained from this
        course, I am equipped with the knowledge and skills to venture into the world, employing close reading
        techniques to critically analyze and address real-world issues. By scrutinizing the texts and movies I
        encountered, I gained a heightened awareness of the social inequalities, injustices, and cultural complexities
        that shape our global community.
