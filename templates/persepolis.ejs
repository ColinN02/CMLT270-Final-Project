    <h2>
        Persepolis
    </h2>

    <p>
        In this course, we've read the graphic novel Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi. The novel tells the story of her
        life
        growing up in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. The story begins with
        Marjane's childhood in Tehran in the 1970s, where she was raised in a liberal, intellectual family. When the
        Islamic
        Revolution of 1979 occurs, Marjane's family struggles to adapt to the new fundamentalist regime.

        As Marjane grows up, she becomes increasingly disillusioned with the new government and the restrictions placed
        on
        personal freedom. She rebels against the regime by listening to banned music and protesting against the
        government.
        Her parents eventually send her to live with relatives in Austria for her safety, where she experiences a new
        set of
        challenges as an Iranian immigrant.

        Marjane eventually returns to Iran, but finds that her homeland has changed in ways she never imagined. She
        becomes
        depressed and alienated, and eventually decides to leave Iran for good. The story ends with Marjane reflecting
        on
        her experiences and the importance of her family and her homeland to her identity.

        Persepolis conveys a powerful coming-of-age story that explores themes of identity, family, politics, and
        cultural
        differences. Through Marjane's personal journey, readers gain insight into the complexities of Iranian history
        and
        culture, as well as the challenges faced by immigrants and those living under repressive regimes.

        In the graphic novel Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi, the main character goes through changes as she starts to
        adopt Western culture. At the beginning, Marjane is shown happily dancing and pretending to play an electric
        guitar with her tennis racket in her room. She has a new Iron Maiden poster on her wall, a gift from her
        parents' trip to Turkey. This shows that Marjane is becoming interested in English customs and starting to like
        heavy metal bands. In the next scene, Marjane poses like the famous English singer Kim Wilde, indicating her
        growing fascination with Western music and its influence on her. In later scenes, Marjane carefully chooses her
        clothes, wearing Nike shoes and a denim jacket while still wearing her veil loosely on her head, revealing her
        hair. This shows that she is developing a sense of Western fashion and gradually moving away from her Iranian
        heritage. Marjane wants to fit in with Western society, as shown by her fashion choices
        and her interest in the music and fashion culture of Austria, where she currently lives. Through these
        illustrations, Satrapi effectively shows how Marjane assimilates into a new culture while keeping parts of her
        own identity.
